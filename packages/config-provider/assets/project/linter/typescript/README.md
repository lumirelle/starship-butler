# TypeScript Configs

This folder contains four sub-folders categorized by project type:

- Library: For JavaScript/TypeScript library projects
- Vue + Webpack: Downgrade to JavaScript, use JSDoc for type support (also applies to Nuxt 2)
- Vue + Vite: For Vue + Vite projects, requires `@vue/tsconfig` and `@tsconfig/node24`
- Nuxt 4: For Nuxt 4 projects

> [!Note]
>
> Nuxt 2 projects should use the Vue + Webpack configuration. Nuxt 3 projects are encouraged to upgrade to Nuxt 4.
